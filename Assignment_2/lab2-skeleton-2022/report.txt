This program does not work as everything happens in inst-decoder.cc.
inst-formatter.cc calls inst-decoder.cc which prints the outcomes of the given files 
(e.g. ./rv64-emu -X ../lab2-test-programs-2022/basic.bin)
stages.cc is not used, therefore no pipeline registers were used.
This also means no testing and technically nothing works.

Input which has less than 32 bits (e.g. 0x07ffffee) will have 0s
added at the front of the value in order to get to 32 bits.
This causes illegal instruction exceptions to be handed out
in some cases (e.g. 0x07ffffee)
